### User Feedback
Provides actionable feedback for user actions such as:
- Form submission success messages
- File upload notifications
- Inline validation errors

### Tabular Data Display
- Displays submitted form data in a table
- Includes Edit and Delete actions for managing submitted entries

### Progress Indicator
- Shows progress through a progress bar as fields are completed
- Displays a success animation after form submission

### Error Handling
Handles API request failures gracefully, displaying user-friendly error messages
